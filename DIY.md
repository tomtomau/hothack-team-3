This doc is supposed to help with if you'd like to set up another repository like this for yourself.

## Cloudflare

Signup to Cloudflare: https://www.cloudflare.com/

It seems to have a pretty generous tier for hobby scale projects ðŸš€. We are using `Cloudflare Pages` which is a service
from Cloudflare to host "static sites". Our React application is considered a big static site - all the dynamic nature
happens in the users browser ðŸ•º

## Setting up new Cloudflare pages

Cloudflare has great documentation on how to setup a React site:

https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/

If you'd like to learn other Frameworks, there's other examples such as:

* [Angular](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-angular-site/)
* [Vue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-vue-site/)

## Deploying

The above links from Cloudflare have instructions on deployments,
but it's _very_ achievable to run your project in prod ðŸš€
